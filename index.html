    <h1>Robot Battledome</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Code/Tools Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Use ES6 language features wherever you can. At a minimum, you should be using <strong>let</strong>, <strong>const</strong>, fat arrows, property shorthand, method properties, and string templates.</li>
      <li>Have a Gulp task running at all times to validate your JavaScript. We will be validating your project and we should see 0 errors.</li>
      <li>You must have a test suite that validates the core logic of the application.</li>
      <li>You must use jQuery for interacting with the DOM.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Base Logical Requirements</h3>
    <p>You'll be building robots to battle each other.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A base Robot function.</li>
      <li>Define three robot type functions (e.g. Drone, Bipedal, ATV).</li>
      <li>Define at least 2 specific robot model functions for each type.</li>
      <li>Give each robot model a different range of health. For example, one model can have health range of 50-80, and another one will have a range of 60-120. To accomplish this, read about the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random">Math.random()</a> function in JavaScript.</li>
      <li>Give each robot model a different range of damage they do using the same technique.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Base Functional Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>When your user interface first loads, provide 2 text inputs to name the two robots that will do battle.</li>
      <li>You must also provide a select element underneath each text input so that the user can select one of the 6 robot models you defined.</li>
      <li>Provide a Attack! button that, when clicked, simply applies the damage output of each robot against the other one.</li>
      <li>Once either robot's health is &lt;0 display a message that the battle is over, and which one won. For example...</li>
    </ol>

<!--<h2>Bonus Goals</h2>
    <h3>Bonus Logical Requirements</h3>
    <p>These are <strong>completely</strong> optional, once you have the basic requirements met and want to practice object composition.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Define at least six different modifications and six different weapons that can be added to a robot.</li>
      <li>Each modification should provide some combination of the following benefits - increased protection, increased damage, or evasion capability (ability to avoid some attacks).</li>
      <li>Define the range of damage that each weapon can do. </li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Bonus Functional Requirements</h3>
    <p>If you have completed the base requirements, and want to explore object composition more, you may choose to implement these requirements. They are <strong>completely</strong> optional.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>When your user interface first loads, provide the user with buttons so that one specific robot model can be chosen as Player 1.</li>
      <li>Once the user selects a robot model for Player 1, show a button for each weapon that can be added to the robot.</li>
      <li>Once the user selects a weapon for Player 1, show a button for each modification that can be added to the robot.</li>
      <li>Once Player 1 has a modification, provide the user with buttons so that one specific robot model can be chosen as Player 2.</li>
      <li>Once the user selects a robot model for Player 2, show a button for each weapon that can be added to the robot.</li>
      <li>Once the user selects a weapon for Player 2, show a button for each modification that can be added to the robot.</li>
      <li>Once the modification for Player 2 is chosen, the battle begins.</li>
      <li>Each round of battle should determine the amount of damage each robot will do with its weapon.</li>
      <li>That damage should then be adjusted based on the modifications that it has, and what its opponent has.</li>
      <li>Rounds continue until one of the robots has 0, or less than 0, health.</li>
      <li>When the battle is over display the outcome to the user. For example...</li>
    </ol>
